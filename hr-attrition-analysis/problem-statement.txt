1. What are the key factors driving employee attrition?
Use correlation and feature importance techniques to identify which variables (e.g., job satisfaction, overtime, income) most strongly influence whether employees leave.

2. Which job roles have the highest attrition rates?
Analyze attrition by job role to help HR focus retention strategies on critical roles with high turnover.

3. How does employee satisfaction correlate with attrition?
Explore how job satisfaction levels relate to attrition and if dissatisfaction predicts resignation.

4. What is the impact of overtime on employee retention?
Investigate if employees working overtime are more likely to quit and by how much.

5. Does salary influence attrition?
Analyze monthly income ranges and their corresponding attrition rates to see if pay is a factor.

6. How does length of service affect attrition risk?
Identify if newer employees leave more often than those with longer tenure.

7. Are there demographic trends in attrition?
Look at age, marital status, and distance from home to see if any demographic groups are more prone to resign.

8. Can we predict which employees are at high risk of leaving?
Build a classification model to predict attrition, using the dataset features.

9. What combinations of factors lead to the highest attrition?
Use clustering or decision trees to find common profiles of employees who leave.

10. How can HR improve employee retention based on the data?
Provide actionable recommendations (e.g., improve work-life balance, increase pay, reduce overtime).
